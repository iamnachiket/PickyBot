# PickyBot  

PickyBot is a bot that automatically swipes left on profiles that contain no bio/really short bio, no faces. It also swipes
left if specific user-given words are present in the bio. It swipes right otherwise.  

PickyBot creates 'words.txt'. In that file, words should be added on individual lines. PickyBot can also be used to filter out
profiles that contain overused phrases. The phrases can be added on a new line in the text file.  

# How to use?
